            You are reviewing a pull request for merge into ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}.

            **PR Details:**
            - Title: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
            - Author: @${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login }}
            - Changed files: ${{ github.event.pull_request.changed_files }}

            **Your Task:**
            1. Review the git diff between base and PR branch
            2. Check for:
               - Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets, etc.)
               - Logic errors and edge cases
               - Code quality issues (complexity, duplication, naming)
               - Missing tests for new functionality
               - Breaking changes or backward compatibility issues
               - Performance concerns
            3. Identify blocking issues vs suggestions
            4. Be constructive and specific with file:line references

            **Review Command:**
            ```bash
            git diff origin/${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}..HEAD
            ```

            **Output Format:**
            Provide your review as markdown with:
            - 🚨 **Blocking Issues** (must fix before merge)
            - ⚠️  **Warnings** (should fix)
            - 💡 **Suggestions** (nice to have)
            - ✅ **Strengths** (what's done well)

            Be concise but thorough. Focus on real issues, not nitpicks.
